# PatientChemodose_prediction

It is a simplified dataset including time serial chemodose for patients in one hospital.
The goal of the project is to develop a model to predict chemodose 

I run model selection and compared performance for different models, such as Random forest, Gradientboosting and LSTM. 
The feature importance was also calculated for the models.
